#Academic Project


#Objective : Analyze the cache misses of three algorithm that calculates the optimal global alignment of two genetic sequences (DNA)



Team : Team of 2
Time Spent : ~10 hours
Technologies used:
- Python

Type of algorithm:
- an iterative algorithm, choosing how to store and traverse the array;
- a cache aware algorithm which uses the Z and L parameters of a cache level as input;
- a cache oblivious algorithm that does not use any parameters on the cache.
